title: Aggregate functions
---

Aggregate functions operate on values across rows to perform mathematical calculations such as sum, average, counting, minimum/maximum values, standard deviation, and estimation, as well as some non-mathematical operations.

An aggregate function takes multiple rows (actually, zero, one, or more rows) as input and produces a single output. In contrast, scalar functions take one row as input and produce one row (one value) as output.

An aggregate function always returns exactly one row, **even when the input contains zero rows**. Typically, if the input contains zero rows, the output is NULL. However, an aggregate function could return 0, an empty string, or some other value when passed zero rows.
