Comparison operators are used to test the equality of two input expressions. They are typically used in the `WHERE` clause of a query.

## List of comparison operators

| Operator | Syntax   | Description                          |
|----------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `=`      | `a = b`  | `a` is equal to `b`.                 |
| `!=`     | `a != b` | `a` is not equal to `b`.             |
| `<>`     | `a <> b` | `a` is not equal to `b`.             |
| `>`      | `a > b`  | `a` is greater than `b`.             |
| `>=`     | `a >= b` | `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. |
| `<`      | `a < b`  | `a` is less than `b`.                |
