title: Logical/Boolean operators
---

Logical operators return the result of a particular Boolean operation on one or two input expressions.

They can only be used as a predicate (e.g. in the WHERE clause). Input expressions must be predicates.

## List of logical/Boolean operators

| Operator | Syntax    | Description                    |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| `AND`    | `a AND b` | Matches both expressions.      |
| `OR`     | `a OR b`  | Matches either expression.     |
| `NOT`    | `NOT a`   | Does not match the expression. |
